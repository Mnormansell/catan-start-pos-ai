## CS4710 Final Project

This project looks to implement various AI agents to optimally pick start positions in Settlers of Catan. This project involes modifying a [catan python library](https://github.com/rosshamish/catan-py) by [rosshamish](https://github.com/rosshamish) to improve game logic, rules, and add the agents. Furthermore, we use modify another library by ross, a [catan GUI](https://github.com/rosshamish/catan-spectator), to improve the GUI and add our AI functionality. We are packaging both libraries together as we are significantly adding to both.
